        <ol>
            <li>
                Place potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. 
                Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain and transfer potatoes to a bowl; coarsely mash.
            </li>
            <li>
                Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
            </li>
            <li>
                Heat oil in a skillet over medium-high heat; cook and stir onions, salt,allspice,until onion is lightly browned, about 5 minutes. 
                Remove skillet from heat and stir tomatoes and peas into onion mixture; pour into mashed potatoes and thoroughly mix. Cool completely.
            </li>
            <li>
                Cut each pie crust into 8 even triangles. Spoon filling onto the wide end of each triangle; 
                fold corners over filling creating a triangular 'hat' shape. Pinch the dough together to form a seal. 
                Brush egg white over each samosa and arrange on a baking sheet.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake in the preheated oven until samosas are golden brown, about 15 minutes.
